### Description

*Association schemes are structures that can be viewed as generalizations of algebraic structures such as groups, as well as combinatorial structures such as distance-regular graphs. These structures have been applied to prove various results from a wide range of areas of mathematics which can be of algebraic aspects (representation theory of quantum groups, scaffold calculus, Terwilliger algebras) and combinatorial aspects (Erdős-Ko-Rado type theorems, design and coding theory, finite geometry). This session is dedicated to recent trends in the study of association schemes and their applications.*

The 2024 CMS Summer Meeting will be held from May 31 to June 3  at the **University of Saskatchewan** (Saskatoon, Canada).
