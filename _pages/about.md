I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Regina. My advisors are  [Karen Meagher](http://uregina.ca/~meagherk/) and [Shaun Fallat](http://uregina.ca/~sfallat/).

I primarily work on [Erdős–Ko–Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Ko%E2%80%93Rado_theorem) type results for various combinatorial objects with algebraic flavours. I am particularly interested in problems related to permutation groups and algebraic graph theory. My other research interest is the study of Cayley graphs. Feel free to contact me by email for more details.

You can find my CV [here.](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf)
