I am a postdoctoral researcher in algebraic graph theory at the University of Primorska, working under the mentorship of [Dr. Dragan Marušič](https://www.famnit.upr.si/sl/zaposleni-in-sodelavci/dragan.marusic/). I completed my PhD in 2022 at the University of Regina under the supervision of  [Dr. Karen Meagher](http://uregina.ca/~meagherk/) and [Dr. Shaun Fallat](http://uregina.ca/~sfallat/).

I primarily work on [Erdős–Ko–Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Ko%E2%80%93Rado_theorem) type results for various combinatorial objects with algebraic flavours. I am particularly interested in problems related to permutation groups and algebraic graph theory. My other research interest is the study of Cayley graphs. Feel free to contact me by email for more details.
