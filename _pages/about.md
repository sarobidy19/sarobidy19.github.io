I am a Fields Institute postdoctoral fellow at Carleton University working with [Brett Stevens](https://carleton.ca/math/people/brett-stevens/) and [Steven Wang](https://people.math.carleton.ca/~wang/). From July 2024 to June 2025, I was the 2024 Fields-AIMS-Perimeter postdoctoral fellow at the Fields Institute, where I worked with [Ada Chan](https://www.yorku.ca/ssachan/). From September 2022 to June 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher in algebraic graph theory at the University of Primorska, working under the mentorship of [Dragan Marušič](https://www.famnit.upr.si/sl/zaposleni-in-sodelavci/dragan.marusic/). I completed my Ph.D in 2022 at the University of Regina under the supervision of  [Karen Meagher](https://uregina.ca/~meagherk/) and [Shaun Fallat](https://uregina.ca/~sfallat/).

I primarily work on topics in algebraic graph theory. I am particularly interested in the part of algebraic graph theory that deals with permutation group theory, spectral graph theory, and association schemes. 

I am currently working on [Erdős–Ko–Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Ko%E2%80%93Rado_theorem) type results for various combinatorial objects with algebraic flavours. Recently, I have also started working on problems on distance-regular graphs, Terwilliger algebras, and quantum walks in graphs. 

Feel free to contact me by email for more details.
