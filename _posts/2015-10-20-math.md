## Introduction

Let $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ be the set of all permutations of the set $$[n]:= \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$$. We say that a subset $$ \mathcal{F} \subset \operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ is intersecting if for any $$\sigma,\tau \in \mathcal{F}$$ there exists $$i \in [n]$$ such that $$\sigma(i) = \tau(i)$$.

Of interest to us is the size and the structure of maximum intersecting sets of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$. It was proved by Deza and Frankl in 1977 such that
\begin{equation}
|\mathcal{F}| \leq (n-1)!.
\end{equation}
Note that the size of a point stabilizer of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ is  $$ \frac{|\operatorname{Sym}(n)|}{n} = (n-1)!$$, since it acts transitivily on $$[n]$$.

The characterization of the maximum intersecting set of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ was only proved in 2004 by Cameron and Ku, independently by Larose and Malvenuto. They proved that if $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ is intersecting of maximum size, then $$\mathcal{F}$$ is a coset of a stabilizer of a point. That is, there exists $$i,j\in [n]$$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F} = \\{ \sigma \in \operatorname{Sym}(n) \mid \sigma(i) = j \\}.
\end{equation}

In this post, I will show the importance of the conjugacy class consisting of the $$n$$-cycles in the intersection property of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$.

## Derangement graphs

Now, we will describe a graph that is closely related to the intersection property of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$. The *derangement graph* $$\Gamma_n$$ is the graph whose vertices consist of elements of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ and two permutations $$\sigma$$ and $$\tau$$ are adjacent if $$\tau^{-1} \sigma $$ is a *derangement*, i.e., a *fixed-point-free* permutation.

The derangement graph $$\Gamma_n$$ contains the intersecting properties of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$. Indeed, if $$\mathcal{F} \subset \operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ is intersecting, then for any $$\sigma, \tau \in \mathcal{F}$$ there exists $$i \in [n]$$ such that $$\sigma(i) = \tau(i) \Leftrightarrow \tau^{-1}\sigma(i) = i$$. In other words, $$\mathcal{F}$$ is a *coclique* or an *independent set* of $$\Gamma_n$$. Conversely, given a coclique $$C$$ of $$\Gamma_n$$, any two elements $$\sigma,\tau \in C$$ are non-adjacent, so there exists $$i \in [n]$$ such that $$\tau^{-1}\sigma(i) = i$$. Hence, $$C$$ is intersecting.

Consequently, the largest intersecting set of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ has size $$\alpha(\Gamma_n)$$, which is the size of the largest cocliques of $$\Gamma_n$$. Moreover, the structure of the largest intersecting sets are given by those cocliques of size $$\alpha(\Gamma_n)$$.

Due to this correspondence between cocliques of $$\Gamma_n$$ and intersecting sets of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$, it is of interest to study $$\Gamma_n$$. First, it is not hard to see that $$\Gamma_n$$ is equal to the *Cayley graph* $$\operatorname{Cay}(\operatorname{Sym},D_n)$$, where $$D_n = \{ \sigma \in \operatorname{Sym}(n) \mid \sigma \mbox{ is a derangement} \}$$. Therefore, $$\Gamma_n$$ is *vertex transitive* (i.e., its automorphism group is transitive).

## The conjugacy class scheme

The edges of $$\Gamma_n$$ are determined by the set $$D_n$$. It is not hard to see that $$D_n$$ is a union of conjugacy classes. Precisely, $$D_n$$ is the union of conjugacy classes of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ that do not have $$1$$ in their cycle type. We will show that the adjacency matrix of $$\Gamma_n$$ is a sum of matrices in an association scheme determined by the conjugacy classees.

It is well-known that the conjugacy classes of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ are determined by the partitions of the integer $n$. Given a partition $$\lambda$$ of $$n$$, we let $$C_\lambda$$ be the corresponding conjugacy class. For any partition $$\lambda \vdash n$$, we define the $$n!\times n!$$ matrix $$A_\lambda$$ to be the matrix which is indexed in its rows and columns by elements of $$\operatorname{Sym}(n)$$ and with entry
\begin{equation}
  A_\lambda (\sigma,\tau) =
  \begin{cases}
      1 & \mbox{ if }\tau^{-1}\sigma \in C_\lambda \newline
      0 & \mbox{ otherwise}
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
