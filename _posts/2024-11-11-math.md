Let $$G$$ be a finite group with identity $$1$$ and let $$C \subset G\setminus \{1\}$$ be such that $$C^{-1} = C$$ and $$gCg^{-1} = C$$ for all $$g\in G$$. Let $$X = \operatorname{Cay}(G,C)$$ be the Cayley graph of $$G$$ with connection set $$C$$, and let $$K = \operatorname{Aut}{X}$$. For any $$g\in G$$, we define $$\lambda_g,\rho_g: G\to G$$ such that $$x^{\lambda_g} = g^{-1}x$$ and $$x^{\rho_g} = gx$$, for $$x\in G$$. The group $$L_G$$ and $$R_G$$ are respectively the left-regular and right-regular representations of $$G$$. As $$X$$ is a Cayley graph, it is clear that $$R_G\leq \operatorname{Aut}{X}$$. The subgroup $$L_G$$ need not be a subgroup of $$\operatorname{Aut}{X}$$, however, in our case since $$C$$ is a union of conjugacy classes, $$L_G\leq \operatorname{Aut}{X}$$.
