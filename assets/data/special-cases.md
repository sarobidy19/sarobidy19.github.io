## [Prime power degrees](#the-start)

In [[1]](http://www.numdam.org/item/10.5802/alco.209.pdf), it was shown that transitive groups of prime power degrees have intersection density equal to $$1$$. The proof is by induction on the degree of the group, by quotienting and using the fact that the center of a $$p$$-group is never trivial.


## [Product of two odd primes](#the-middle)

It was shown in [[2]](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0097316522001157) that if $$G$$ is a transitive group of degree $$pq$$, where $$p$$ and $$q$$ are distinct odd primes, then the intersection density is equal to $$1$$, unless $$G$$ is *quasiprimitive* or there is a certain cyclic code of $$\mathbb{F}_q^p$$ whose Hamming weight is at most $$p-1$$.
